# Our Integration List

Our API endpoint can be integrated with popular AI workflow platforms and tools, allowing their users to access our models through these environments.

<table><thead><tr><th width="124">Service</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="agno.md">Agno</a></td><td>A lightweight library for building agents — AI programs that operate autonomously, use tools, and have memory, knowledge, storage, and reasoning capabilities.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="autogpt.md">AutoGPT</a></td><td>An open-source platform designed to help you build, test, and run AI agents using a no-code visual interface. It allows users to link LLMs with tools, memory, planning modules, and action chains.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="cline.md">Cline</a></td><td>An open-source AI coding assistant with two working modes (Plan/Act), terminal command execution, and support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in VS Code.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="continue.dev.md">continue.dev</a></td><td>An open-source IDE extension and hub for rules, tools, and models that let you create, share, and use custom AI code assistants.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="cursor.md">Cursor</a></td><td>An advanced AI-powered IDE that combines intelligent code completion, inline explanations, and automatic code editing directly inside the editor.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="elizaos.md">ElizaOS</a></td><td>A powerful multi-agent simulation framework designed to create, deploy, and manage autonomous AI agents. Built with TypeScript, it provides a flexible and extensible platform for developing intelligent agents that can interact across multiple platforms while maintaining consistent personalities and knowledge.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="gpt-researcher-gptr.md">GPT Researcher</a></td><td>An autonomous agent that takes care of the tedious task of research for you, by scraping, filtering and aggregating over 20+ web sources per a single research task.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="langflow.md">Langflow</a></td><td>A new visual framework for building multi-agent and RAG applications. It is open-source, Python-powered, fully customizable, and LLM and vector store agnostic. Its intuitive interface allows for easy manipulation of AI building blocks, enabling developers to quickly prototype and turn their ideas into powerful, real-world solutions.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="litellm.md">LiteLLM</a></td><td>An open-source Python library that provides a unified API for interacting with multiple large language model providers. It allows developers to switch between different models with minimal code changes, optimizing cost and performance. LiteLLM simplifies integration by offering a single interface for various LLM endpoints, enabling seamless experimentation and deployment across different AI providers.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="make.md">Make</a></td><td>A powerful, enterprise-scale automation platform. It offers flow control, data manipulation, HTTP/webhooks, AI agents and tools, notes, an MCP server, and many other features at your service.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="n8n.md">n8n</a></td><td>An open-source workflow automation tool that lets you connect various services and automate tasks without writing full integrations manually.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="roo-code.md">Roo Code</a></td><td>An autonomous AI programming agent that works right inside your editor, such as VS Code. It helps you code faster and smarter — whether you're starting a new project, maintaining existing code, or exploring new technologies.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="sillytavern.md">SillyTavern</a></td><td>A locally installed user interface that allows you to interact with text generation LLMs, image generation engines, and TTS voice models. Integration with the AI/ML API currently applies only to LLMs.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="toolhouse.md">Toolhouse</a></td><td>A Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) to build, run, and manage AI agents. Toolhouse simplifies the process of building agents in a local environment and running them in production.</td></tr></tbody></table>
