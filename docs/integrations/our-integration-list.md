# Our Integration List

Our API endpoint can be integrated with popular AI workflow platforms and tools, allowing their users to access our models through these environments.

<table><thead><tr><th width="109">Service</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="agno.md">Agno</a></td><td>A lightweight library for building agents — AI programs that operate autonomously, use tools, and have memory, knowledge, storage, and reasoning capabilities.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="cline.md">Cline</a></td><td>An open-source AI coding assistant with two working modes (Plan/Act), terminal command execution, and support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in VS Code.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="elizaos.md">ElizaOS</a></td><td>A powerful multi-agent simulation framework designed to create, deploy, and manage autonomous AI agents. Built with TypeScript, it provides a flexible and extensible platform for developing intelligent agents that can interact across multiple platforms while maintaining consistent personalities and knowledge.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="gpt-researcher-gptr.md">GPT Researcher</a></td><td>An autonomous agent that takes care of the tedious task of research for you, by scraping, filtering and aggregating over 20+ web sources per a single research task.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="langflow.md">Langflow</a></td><td>A new visual framework for building multi-agent and RAG applications. It is open-source, Python-powered, fully customizable, and LLM and vector store agnostic. Its intuitive interface allows for easy manipulation of AI building blocks, enabling developers to quickly prototype and turn their ideas into powerful, real-world solutions.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="litellm.md">LiteLLM</a></td><td>An open-source Python library that provides a unified API for interacting with multiple large language model providers. It allows developers to switch between different models with minimal code changes, optimizing cost and performance. LiteLLM simplifies integration by offering a single interface for various LLM endpoints, enabling seamless experimentation and deployment across different AI providers.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="roo-code.md">Roo Code</a></td><td>An autonomous AI programming agent that works right inside your editor, such as VS Code. It helps you code faster and smarter — whether you're starting a new project, maintaining existing code, or exploring new technologies.</td></tr></tbody></table>
