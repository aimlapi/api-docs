Hi — I didn't get any content. I can convert a webpage or existing Markdown/HTML into GitBook-optimized Markdown (using tabs, steppers, expandable FAQ, code block tabs, etc.).

Please provide one of the following:

* The webpage URL to import, or
* The raw Markdown/HTML content, or
* A file (paste) you want converted.

Also tell me:

* Any specific transformations you want (e.g., convert numbered steps to a stepper, group npm/yarn/pnpm into tabs, convert FAQs to expandable blocks).
* Whether to preserve images as-is or replace with placeholders.

Once you share the content/URL and options, I’ll produce the GitBook-ready Markdown.
