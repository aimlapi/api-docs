## Model Overview

A world-class model with comparable quality to DeepSeek R1 while outperforming [GPT-4.1](../openai/gpt-4.1.md) and [Claude Sonnet 3.7](../anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet.md). Optimized for both complex reasoning and efficient dialogue.

## How to Make a Call

<details>

<summary>Step-by-Step Instructions</summary>

### :digit\_one:  Setup You Canâ€™t Skip

:black\_small\_square:  [**Create an Account**](https://aimlapi.com/app/sign-up): Visit the AI/ML API website and create an account (if you donâ€™t have one yet).\
:black\_small\_square:  [**Generate an API Key**](https://aimlapi.com/app/keys): After logging in, navigate to your account dashboard and generate your API key. Ensure that key is enabled on UI.

### &#x20;:digit\_two:  Copy the code example

Below, you'll find [a code example](qwen3-32b.md#code-example) that shows how to structure the request. Choose the code snippet in your preferred programming language and copy it into your development environment.

### :digit\_three:  Modify the code example

:black\_small\_square:  Replace `<YOUR_AIMLAPI_KEY>` with your actual AI/ML API key from your account.\
:black\_small\_square:  Insert your question or request into the `content` fieldâ€”this is what the model will respond to.

### :digit\_four:  <sup><sub><mark style="background-color:yellow;">(Optional)<mark style="background-color:yellow;"><sub></sup> Adjust other optional parameters if needed

Only `model` and `messages` are required parameters for this model (and weâ€™ve already filled them in for you in the example), but you can include optional parameters if needed to adjust the modelâ€™s behavior. Below, you can find the corresponding [API schema](qwen3-32b.md#api-schema), which lists all available parameters along with notes on how to use them.

### :digit\_five:  Run your modified code

Run your modified code in your development environment. Response time depends on various factors, but for simple prompts it rarely exceeds a few seconds.

The example above prints the raw output of the model. The text is typically split into multiple chunks. While this is helpful for debugging, if your goal is to evaluate the model's reasoning and get a clean, human-readable response, you should aggregate both the reasoning and the final answer in a loop â€” for example:

<summary>Example with response parsing</summary>

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```python
import requests
import json

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.aimlapi.com/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={
        # Insert your AIML API Key instead of <YOUR_AIMLAPI_KEY>:
        "Authorization": "Bearer b72af53a19ea41caaf5a74ba1f6fc62b",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    json={
        "model": "alibaba/qwen3-32b",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                
                # Insert your question for the model here, instead of Hello:
                "content": "Hello" 
            }
        ],
        "stream": True,
    }
)

answer = ""
reasoning = ""

for line in response.iter_lines():
    if not line or not line.startswith(b"data:"):
        continue

    try:
        raw = line[6:].decode("utf-8").strip()
        if raw == "[DONE]":
            continue

        data = json.loads(raw)
        choices = data.get("choices")
        if not choices or "delta" not in choices[0]:
            continue

        delta = choices[0]["delta"]
        content_piece = delta.get("content")
        reasoning_piece = delta.get("reasoning_content")

        if content_piece:
            answer += content_piece
        if reasoning_piece:
            reasoning += reasoning_piece

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error parsing chunk: {e}")


print("\n--- MODEL REASONING ---")
print(reasoning.strip())

print("\n--- MODEL RESPONSE ---")
print(answer.strip())
```
{% endcode %}

</details>

After running such code, you'll receive only the model's textual output in a clear and structured format:

<details>

<summary>Response</summary>

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```json5
--- MODEL REASONING ---
Okay, the user sent "Hello". I need to respond appropriately. Since it's a greeting, I should reply in a friendly and welcoming manner. Maybe ask how I can assist them. Keep it simple and open-ended to encourage them to share what they need help with. Let me make sure the tone is positive and helpful.

--- MODEL RESPONSE ---
Hello! How can I assist you today? ðŸ˜Š
```
{% endcode %}
