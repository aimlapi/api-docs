# grok-3-mini-beta

{% hint style="info" %}
This documentation is valid for the following list of our models:

* `x-ai/grok-3-mini-beta`
{% endhint %}

## Model Overview

A lighter version of the [Grok 3 Beta model](grok-3-beta.md), designed for quicker response times while maintaining robust reasoning capabilities. It is particularly suited for applications where speed is prioritized over exhaustive accuracy checks.

## How to Make a Call

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Setup You Canâ€™t Skip&#x20;

:black\_small\_square:  [**Create an Account**](https://aimlapi.com/app/sign-up): Visit the AI/ML API website and create an account (if you donâ€™t have one yet).\
:black\_small\_square:  [**Generate an API Key**](https://aimlapi.com/app/keys): After logging in, navigate to your account dashboard and generate your API key. Ensure that key is enabled on UI.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Copy the code example

At the bottom of this page, you'll find [a code example](grok-3-mini-beta.md#code-example-python) that shows how to structure the request. Choose the code snippet in your preferred programming language and copy it into your development environment.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Modify the code example

:black\_small\_square:  Replace `<YOUR_AIMLAPI_KEY>` with your actual AI/ML API key from your account.\
:black\_small\_square:  Insert your question or request into the `content` fieldâ€”this is what the model will respond to.
{% endstep %}

### <sup><sub><mark style="background-color:yellow;">(Optional)<mark style="background-color:yellow;"><sub></sup> Adjust other optional parameters if needed

Only `model` and `messages` are required parameters for this model (and weâ€™ve already filled them in for you in the example), but you can include optional parameters if needed to adjust the modelâ€™s behavior. Below, you can find the corresponding [API schema](grok-3-mini-beta.md#api-schema), which lists all available parameters along with notes on how to use them.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Run your modified code

Run your modified code in your development environment. Response time depends on various factors, but for simple prompts it rarely exceeds a few seconds.
{% endstep %}
