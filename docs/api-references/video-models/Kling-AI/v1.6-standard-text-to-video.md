## Model Overview

## Setup your API Key

If you donâ€™t have an API key for the AI/ML API yet, feel free to use our [Quickstart guide](https://docs.aimlapi.com/quickstart/setting-up).

## How to Make a Call

Generating a video using this model involves making two sequential API calls:

* The first one is for creating and sending a video generation task to the server (returns a generation ID).&#x20;
* The second one is for requesting the generated or extended video from the server using the generation ID received from the first endpoint.&#x20;

Below, you can find both corresponding API schemas.

## API Schemas

### Create a video generation task and send it to the server

{% openapi src="v1.6-standard-text-to-video.json" path="/v2/generate/video/kling/generation" method="post" %}
[v1.6-standard-text-to-video.json](v1.6-standard-text-to-video.json)
{% endopenapi %}

### Retrieve the generated video from the server

After sending a request for video generation, this task is added to the queue. Based on the service's load, the generation can be completed in seconds or take a bit more.&#x20;

{% openapi src="v1.6-standard-text-to-video-pair.json" path="/v2/generate/video/kling/generation" method="get" %}
[v1.6-standard-text-to-video-pair.json](v1.6-standard-text-to-video-pair.json)
