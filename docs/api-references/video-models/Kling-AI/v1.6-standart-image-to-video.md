## Model Overview

An advanced AI video generation model developed by Kuaishou Technology, designed to create high-quality videos from text prompts and images. This version introduces significant improvements in prompt adherence, visual quality, and dynamic action rendering, enabling users to generate more consistent and visually appealing results compared to its predecessor, Kling 1.5.

## Setup your API Key

If you don’t have an API key for the AI/ML API yet, feel free to use our [Quickstart guide](https://docs.aimlapi.com/quickstart/setting-up).

## How to Make a Call

Generating a video using this model involves making two sequential API calls:

* The first one is for creating and sending a video generation task to the server (returns a generation ID).&#x20;
* The second one is for requesting the generated or extended video from the server using the generation ID received from the first endpoint.&#x20;

Below, you can find both corresponding API schemas.

## API Schema

### Create a video generation task and send it to the server

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `ratio` and `aspect_ratio` parameters are now deprecated. \
The aspect ratio of the generated video is solely determined by the aspect ratio of the input reference image.
{% endhint %}

{% openapi src="v1.6-standart-image-to-video.json" path="/v2/generate/video/kling/generation" method="post" %}
[v1.6-standart-image-to-video.json](v1.6-standart-image-to-video.json)
{% endopenapi %}

### Retrieve the generated video from the server

After sending a request for video generation, this task is added to the queue. Based on the service's load, the generation can be completed in seconds or take a bit more.&#x20;
