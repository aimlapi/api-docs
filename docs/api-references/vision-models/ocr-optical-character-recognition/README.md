# OCR: Optical Character Recognition

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology enables the extraction of text from images, scanned documents, and PDFs, transforming them into machine-readable formats. Modern OCR systems go beyond simple text recognition, interpreting complex layouts, tables, and even handwritten notes with high accuracy. This technology is widely used in document automation, digital archiving, and accessibility tools, making information more searchable and editable.

Advanced OCR models leverage deep learning to enhance recognition capabilities, accurately distinguishing between different fonts, languages, and structures. Some solutions also integrate natural language processing (NLP) to improve contextual understanding, ensuring better accuracy in document digitization. As OCR technology evolves, it continues to bridge the gap between physical and digital content, streamlining workflows across industries.

We provide APIs from two providers: **Google** and **Mistral AI**. Test both options by making several trial requests and determine which one best suits your needs.
