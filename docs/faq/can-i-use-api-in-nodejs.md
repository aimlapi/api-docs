# Can I use API in NodeJS?

Yes, definitely! Here is a quick guide on how to start your adventure with AI/ML API in NodeJS.

## Installation

### Is it already installed?

Before using an API in NodeJS, you need to ensure that NodeJS is installed on your system. The simplest way is to run a terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

If this command prints a NodeJS version, then you can proceed to the [example article](../quickstart/setting-up.md#example-in-node.js). If not, you need to install NodeJS on your system. The installation steps depend on your operating system, but here are some quick instructions to get you started:

### On Windows / Mac

Install the NodeJS package from the [official distribution site](https://nodejs.org/en). It is preferable to choose the LTS version, but it all depends on your project.

### On Linux

The installation process depends on your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following command to install version 20:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
```

## Using

Test your installation and you can proceed with the tutorial on the [quickstart](broken-reference) page.
